# Detecting Parkinson's Disease with OpenCV and Computer Vision

# Dataset
  i) This project used dataset from [NIATS of Federal University of UberlaÌ‚ndia](http://www.niats.feelt.ufu.br/en/node/81)
  ii) The dataset contains 204 images and was already split into a training set and a test set consisting of:
      a) Spiral: 102 images, 72 training and 30 testing
      b) Wave: 102 images, 72 training and 30 testing

# How to run the program
Run main.py only for the entire code
'''
python main.py -d data/spiral (for Spiral dataset)
OR
python main.py -d data/wave (for Wave dataset)
'''
